## Methods
We analyzed variation in blood mercury levels using mixed-effects models as implemented in R version 3.4.4 [@RCoreTeam2018] in the package <i>lme4</i>[@BatesEtAl2015], version 1.1-15. In brief, we used a model-selection approach [@Burnham2003] to identify the best-supported model from a candidate set of models that reflected alternative hypotheses about sources of variation in blood mercury among <i>Catharus</i> thrushes captured on Mount Mansfield, Vermont between 2000 and 2017. We used Akaike's Information Criteria, corrected for small-sample size (AICc), as the measure of support for each model. We used the number of unique individuals included in the analysis as the sample size for the purposes of calculating AICc. 

Construction of the set of candidate models was informed by previous research on mercury loads in Bicknell's Thrush [@Rimmer2005,@Rimmer2010]. This work demonstrated consistent seasonal declines in mercury levels and inconsistent effects of age and sex; Rimmer et al. [-@Rimmer2005] found that males and older individuals had higher concentrations of mercury in their blood, whereas Rimmer et al. [-@Rimmer2010] found no effect of age or sex on blood-mercury concentration. Given the the apparent generality of the seasonal decline in concentrations of mercury on the blood, we included an effect of day-of-the-year in all models. Thus, the simplest model in our candidate set (excluding the intercept-only null model) included only an effect of sampling date. Rimmer et al. [-@Rimmer2010] suggested that mercury levels in Bicknell's Thrush declined more rapidly earlier in the year, so our next model included a quadratic effect of sampling date. To examine the possibility of age- and sex-related differences in blood-mercury concentrations, we added terms for sex and age (coded as hatch-year, second-year, or after-second-year) to the better-supported of the two date-only models. 

We next considered a model that allowed for variation in blood-mercury concentration between Bicknell's Thrush and Swainson's Thrush by adding a term for species to the best-supported model. Finally, we tested for potential effects of annual variation in atmospheric deposition of mercury at our study site - previous results [@Rimmer2010] suggest that individuals continue to accumulate mercury during the breeding season - by considering models that included effects of mercurcy deposition during the preceding December - June or during the preceding 1, 2, or 3 years. We included models with a range of lagged effects of mercury deposition because the rate of mercurcy cycling in montane terrestrial systems is largely unquantified. 

For all of the above models, we included individual as a random effect to account for the repeated sampling of some individuals, both within and among years. We used the best-supported model to generate inference. We generated unconditional predictions from the best model and calculated confidence intervals around predictions using the bootstrap approach implemented in the 'bootMer' function of lme4 [@BatesEtAl2015].

We analyzed temporal variation in mercury deposition using generalized additive models as implemented in the R package 'mgcv' version 1.8-23 [@wood2017generalized]. We were interested in examining seasonal and annual variation, so we considered only two models, one that included terms for year and day-of-the-year, and one that included these two main effects and their intereaction, allowing for the possibility that seasonal patterns of mercury depostion have varied over time. We compared the two models using AIC, and selected for inference the model with the lower value.

```
The generalized additive model that included an interaction between year and day-of-the year (gam.m1) had a lower AIC value than did the simpler model (gam.m2) without the interaction, so we used the more complicated model for inference. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
AIC(gam.m1,gam.m2)
```
Day-of-the-year ("doy"), year(YEAR), and the interaction between the two were significant predictors of temporal variation in mercury deposition.

Mercury deposition showed strong yearly and seasonal variation (Fig. 1). Mercury deposition rose from 1993 until 2004, declined from 2005-2010, and then rose sharply again (Fig. 1A). Within years, mercury deposition tended to be greatest during July and August (Fig. 1B).

## Formal analysis of variation in blood-mercury concentration.

The best-supported model (i.e., with the lowest AICc) in the candidate set included an effect of sampling date, age, and sex of the individual. The data did not support an effect of species (i.e., blood-mercury concentrations are similar in Bicknell's Thrush and Swainson's Thrush)(delta AIC = 2.02). We found no evidence, either, for any temporal trend in blood-mercury concentration; the model with a term for "year" had only a slightly higher log-likelihood (LL). Finally, none of the models that included an effect of atmospheric deposition rate (6-month dep, 1-year dep, 2-year dep, or 3-year dep) performed substantially better than the simpler model.

## We can also approach this from a model selection standpoint.
### Two previous papers (Rimmer et al. 2005, 2009) show a seasonal decline in blood mercury levels.
### One paper (Rimmer et al. 2005) also shows an effect of age (older birds have higher burdens) and
### sex (males have higher burdens then females), whereas the other (Rimmer et al. 2009) does not. 
### This suggests the best starting model is a model with an effect of date.
### The next model would include age + sex, to determine whether adding these variables provides a better fit.
### Of these two models, add the effect of species to see whether differences exist between BITH + SWTH.
### Next, consider the possibility of temporal trends by adding a year effect to the best model.
### Finally, ask whether any measure of atmospheric deposition improves model performance.
